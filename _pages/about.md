As of January 2020, I am a Software Engineer at Bloomberg, LP.  I recently completed my PhD in the school of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University.  My advisor was [Krishnamurthy Iyer](https://iyerkri.github.io/), and my thesis was titled "Information Design in Service Systems and Online Markets."   My research interests include Bayesian persuasion, voting theory and queues.
